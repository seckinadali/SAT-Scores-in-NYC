# SAT-Scores-in-NYC

In this project we want to find out the factors that effect SAT scores in New York City the most. We use several data sets provided by the City of New York on [SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), [class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3), [graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2005-2010-Graduation-Outcomes-School-Level/vh2h-md7a), [demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2006-2012-School-Demographics-and-Accountability-S/ihfw-zy9j) and [school surveys](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8).

After cleaning and combining the data sets, we look at correlation coefficients and inspect the items with larger correlation coefficients more closely using scatter plots. Some of our observations are as follows:

- Percentage of students graduating with Regents or Advanced Regents diplomas is a good indication for better average SAT scores

- Students whose native language is not English seem to have some difficulty with SATs

- Schools with more female students have a slight edge in the score interval 1400-1800

- Black and hispanic students seem to be at a disadvantage in the SATs

- Ideal average class size for better SAT scores is in the interval 20-35
